# Text editor using Python

A minimalist yet efficient text editor built using Python's Tkinter library. This project showcases core GUI programming principles with features like file opening, editing, and saving, all wrapped in a clean and responsive interface. Designed to handle .txt files, it highlights my ability to integrate Python with real-world utilities, making it a stepping stone toward mastering GUI-based application development.
